		<p class="am2">Hi! My name is Luisa Fernanda Granada and I am an art
			lover from Colombia, but living in Norwalk,CT. 
			My passion for art ranges from contemporary, modern,
			to very antiche design. It began from and early age 
			when I just draw everything I saw, and ended up being 
			a sky in my bedroom as a teenager!
			I am passionate, creative, constant, perfectionist, and 
			hard-working. Combined with art, I am aslo a passionate
			writter and analyst. I concentrate my career in strategies
			for bussiness, and so I am able to concentrate on my 
			target audience and engage the design in a way that meet
			the standards.
			I am determined and that makes my designs successful 
			and I believe I have a great eye for detail and 
			high-standards. I enjoy everything I do and that is
			the key for great design
